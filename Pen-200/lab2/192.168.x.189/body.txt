Hello! My name is Dwight, and I'm a new member of the IT Team. 

This week I am completing some configurations we rolled out last week.
To make this easier, I've attached a file that will automatically
perform each step. Could you download the attachment, open the
directory, and double-click "automatic_configuration"? Once you
confirm the configuration in the window that appears, you're all done!

If you have any questions, or run into any problems, please let me
know!
